1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,603
Lieutenant Blake kicked off the week with a ventilation refresher.

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,472
Confident but outdated.

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,576
He taught tactics that had been removed from shops months ago.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:17,951
Instructor Harris was assisting that day, but instead of double checking
the lesson plan or referencing current policy, he trusted Blake.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,720
I've done this for years. Approach.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:30,096
Two days later, on an actual fire, a firefighter attempted the outdated
tactic exactly as taught the acting captain stopped it just in time.

7
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:35,001
When the crew debriefed,
they realized there was no documentation for the class.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,172
No lesson plan, no roster. Nothing. Harris had skipped it all.

00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:06,072
Captain Vance provided training on traffic incident management,
including how to set up a traffic control zone

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,142
and use apparatus to block the scene.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:13,313
The drill went smoothly,
but instead of completing the competency sheets,

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:17,884
he stacked them on his desk,
promising he'd finish them before the weekend.

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,052
He didn't.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:24,758
The next week, one of his trainees responded to a traffic collision
and parked the apparatus incorrectly,

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:30,864
allowing a passing car to travel into the scene,
striking a firefighter and causing serious injuries.

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:37,170
After the incident, supervisors pulled the training files
to see whether the firefighter had been signed off.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,138
Nothing.

10
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,572
No verifications.

11
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:44,577
No recorded deficiencies. No proof the skill was ever properly checked.

12
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,648
And to make matters worse, Stone, who had helped with that session,

13
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:55,321
had once again spent more time coaching his preferred firefighters
than ensuring everyone received equal instruction.

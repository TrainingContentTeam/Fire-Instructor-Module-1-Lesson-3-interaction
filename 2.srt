00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:06,139
Later in the week, Lieutenant Reed decided to run a search
and rescue simulation, wanting to keep it real.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:13,380
He skipped equipment checks, bypassed the safety barriers,
and quietly added a smoke bomb for a little extra smoke.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,253
Even though that wasn't approved during the evolution,
one recruit panicked and removed his face piece regulator.

4
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:26,292
Captain Stone was supervising that station,
but he was far more focused on his favorite firefighters,

5
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:31,598
giving them all the attention while brushing off the recruit
who clearly needed guidance.

6
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:36,436
The recruit began suffering from smoke inhalation
and the drill was shut down.

7
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:41,708
The recruit was treated and released at a local hospital
and missed a few days of training.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,577
The safety officer was not amused.
